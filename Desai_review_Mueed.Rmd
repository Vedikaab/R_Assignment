```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


1. I feel its better to always give a path to access the file directly. As I couldn't d "Run all" directly from the code you provided. But the code definitely works otherwise.  

2. All your codes run well. Graphs look good. 

3. Just another suggestion : You could also upload a folder containing just graphs, maybe in .tiff or .png file. 

Great job!
